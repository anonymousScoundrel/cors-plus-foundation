# Some important bits!

As you probably gathered from the JS file this file actually exists
on http://www.addmorehacks.com/cors. If someone finds this in the future
and wants to test it out themselves, you can do what I did:

- Move this file to somewhere on your host server (you're going to need one)
- Modify the JS file's url var to point to correct host/directory.
- Load the index page locally.
- Now you're... CORSing. _okay that was bad_

Keep in mind this is definitely not as secure as it could/should be. Use
at your own discretion.
