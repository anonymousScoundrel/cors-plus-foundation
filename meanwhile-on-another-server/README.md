# Some important bits!

As you probably gathered from the JS file this file actually exists
on http://www.addmorehacks.com/cors. If someone finds this in the future
and wants to test it out themselves. You can do what I did: move this
file to somewhere on your host and modify the JS file to point to your
host server and directory where the file now exists; then just load the
index page locally.

Keep in mind this is definitely not as secure as it could/should be. Use
at your own discretion.
